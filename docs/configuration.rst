Configuration Options
=====================

The IMBIE processor has a number of configuration options, which are specified using a configuration
file. This file should be a plain-text document. The configuration parameters, their purpose, and their
valid values are described below.

All values should be written as Python variables of the appropriate type – for example, text strings
should be contained by quote-marks, and numbers should be written without them. Each parameter
should be written in its own line of the file, and the name of the parameter should be the first entry in
the line, written without quote-marks.

Empty lines are ignored, and the parameters may be specified in any order. Some parameters are
optional, which means that it is not compulsory to provide an entry for them in the configuration. In the
case that an optional parameter is not provided, the default value/behaviour is described here.
The list of options are:

* `input_path` – The directory to search for input data. Absolute or relative paths can be used.
  The processor will search all subdirectories of the input path for ‘.answers.json’ files which
  contain details of data submissions. The processor will then read any CSV-format data files
  specified in the relevant fields of the JSON document

* `output_path` – The directory in which to save plots and tables. Absolute or relative paths
  can be used.

* `export_data` – Optional field. A Boolean value (True or False). If True, the processor will
  export the computed data as CSV files. By default, the value is considered to be False.

* `plot_format` – Optional field. Specifies the format in which to save plots – should be one of
  "png", "jpg", "svg", or "pdf". If this parameter is omitted, the plots will not be saved and will
  instead be rendered in a window.

* `start_date` – Optional field. Specifies the date (in decimal years) from which to begin the
  analysis. All time-series starting before the specified date will be cropped to begin at this date
  (or omitted, if ending before the date provided).

* `stop_date` – Optional field. Specifies the date (in decimal years) at which to end the analysis.
  All time-series ending after the specified date will be cropped to end at this date (or omitted, if
  starting before the date provided).

* `align_date` – Optional field. Specifies the date (in decimal years) at which to align the
  integrated time-series. If this parameter is absent, then the time-series are instead offset such
  that their start-points are aligned with the average time-series.

* `combine_method` – Optional field. Specifies the method used to combine multiple time-
  series. This must be one of:

* `"eqg"` – Equally-weighted groups: Each expirment group has an equal contribution to
  the overall average. By default, this method is used.

* `"eqs"` – Equally-weighted series: Each individual contribution has an equal
  contribution to the overall average

* `"inv"` – Inverse error-weighted: Each individual contribution is weighted according to
  the inverse of its error margin.

* `"imbie1"` – A special method designed to replicate the behaviour of the processor
  used in the IMBIE 2012 analysis: averages are calculated with the same method used
  when averaging time series in the IMBIE 2012 analysis. Groups are equally weighted,
  and error margins are RMS over square root of the number of elements.

* `group_avg_error_method` – Optional field. Specifies the method that should be used to
  compute the error margin when multiple dM/dt time-series from the same experiment group
  are averaged together to produce a single estimate for the group. If omitted, the default
  behaviour depends on the method selected in combine_method. The value must be one of:
  
  * `"sum"` – The sum of the errors.
  
  * `"rms"` – Root Mean Squared.
  
  * `"rss"` – Root Sum Squared.
  
  * `"avg"` – The mean.

  * `"imbie1"` – method used by the IMBIE 2012 analysis: errors are calculated with the
    same method used when averaging time series in the IMBIE 2012 analysis, they are
    RMS over square root of the number of elements.

* `sheet_avg_error_method` – Optional field. Specifies the method that should be used to
  compute the error margin when multiple dM/dt time-series from different experiment groups
  are averaged together to produce a single estimate for an ice sheet. If omitted, the default
  behaviour depends on the method selected in combine_method. The value must be one of:

  * `"sum"` – The sum of the errors.
  
  * `"rms"` – Root Mean Squared.
  
  * `"rss"` – Root Sum Squared.
  
  * `"avg"` – The mean.
  
  * `"imbie1"` – method used by the IMBIE 2012 analysis: errors are calculated with the
    same method used when averaging time series in the IMBIE 2012 analysis, they are
    RMS over square root of the number of elements.

* `sum_errors_method` – Optional field. Specifies the method that should be used to compute
  the error margin when multiple time-series are summed together. This must be one of:

  * `"sum"` – The sum of the errors. By default, this method is used.
  
  * `"rms"` – Root Mean Squared.
  
  * `"rss"` – Root Sum Squared.
  
  * `"avg"` – The mean.
  
  * `"imbie1"` – method used by the IMBIE 2012 analysis: errors are calculated with the
    same method used when averaging time series in the IMBIE 2012 analysis, they are
    RMS over square root of the number of elements.

* `average_nsigma` – Optional field. Specifies the maximum margin when computing the
  average of multiple time-series. Values beyond this multiple of the standard deviation from the
  mean are considered to be outliers, and omitted from the average. By default, there is no
  maximum margin and all values will contribute to the average.

* `users_skip` – Optional field. A list of contributions (specified by the contributer’s username,
  with all capital letters, accents or diacritic marks removed, eg 'Sørensen' should be written

* `users_mark` – Optional field. A list of contributions (specified by the contributer’s surname)
  to mark in dM/dt and dM time-series plots. Multiple usernames can be specified, separated by
  whitespace. This parameter can be used to indicate the identity of outlying contributions.

* `plot_smooth_window` – Optional field. Specifies the time-window (in decimal years) which
  should be used when applying a moving average to dM/dt time-series plots. By default, no
